k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithms
==============================

This repository includes:

* A supervised k-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm, coded with broadcasting techniques in NumPy and SciPy, and tested using the sci-kit learn breast cancer dataset
* A matrix imputation k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, coded using the same techniques as above, and tested on the Boston Housing dataset, also from sci-kit learn.

The former of these algorithms was coded for practice. The latter was coded in the hopes it will eventually be integratable with sci-kit learn, as the matrix imputers available as of yet do not include k-Nearest Neighbors.
